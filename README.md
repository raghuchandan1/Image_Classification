# Image_Classification
Classification of dataset containing flowers using Deep Neural Network using PyTorch<br>
## Notebook
The notebook is writtten in Python 3 and uses pre-trained models available in PyTorch to classify flowers<br><br>
## Python Files
The notebook also contains two python files train.py and predict.py<br>
The train.py file takes the model parameters as input, creates a model, trains it and saves the model as a checkpoint.<br>
The predict.py file uses this trained model in the checkpoint to make predictions
